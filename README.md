# lxd-privesc-exploit
lxd privilege escalation (throught container) exploit with an alpine image encoded inside lxd-privesc-exploit.  
Ubuntu default installation systems comes with lxd enable as we can see with id command. But, **by default, really lxd isnt installed  
**lxd-privesc-exploit will work with 100% accuracy when the container is shown in id command result and if lxd is really installed somewhere in the system**.  

# Screenshots
We use some commands to check whats going on and results that lxd is executable.
